# rebeginningprogramminginpython
After 7 years away from python in 2024 I started again. These are just some simple projects that I have completed.
I did a refresher with a online course by Stephen Gruphetta and a class at UCO with Mike Bockus.
My attempt to upload the code from my Vscode folders and files proved to be quite challengeing. In my Techlahoma-oKcoders
cohort for webdevelopment . We begin by creating repositories within github and working down to vscode. Performing the taks in reversse
is not as seamless for a newbie.
Comments from questions I asked:
"So the first screenshot means you haven't actually tracked any files for commit. you have to commit before you can push.
I would do something like "git add ." in the root folder (this adds all files)then "git push" and then it will tell you 
that there is no origin.you need to go to your repo and grab the command/repo name for setting as origin.I can't even 
remember it off the top of my head but it's something like "git origin --remote <repo name> or something."- T.S
T.S also mentioned that at work BitBucket is what is used, this sounds familiar from past projects.
Another way:
"Incase anyone else is wondering how to go from computer to github instead of github to computer when it comes to make repos.  here ya go.
first go to github desktop and click Add -> Create New Repository,then give the repo a name and a path and click Create Repository
you will then see your repo created in your finder/file explorer,open it in vscode and do some coding (or move over whatever project 
you were already working on before you made the repo)go back to github desktop and commit and publish in publish give your repo a name 
(this will be the name on github.com). easiest to just keep it the same as what you named your local one earlier
go to github.com and see it there" B.R
I also read a few articles and watched some Youtube Videos here are the links:

After a lot of struggle, i decided it is easier to start over this time within Git than the other way around. Rework!!! Not fun!!! I know. Hope this helps.
